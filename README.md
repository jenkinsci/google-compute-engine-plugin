# Google Compute Engine Plugin for Jenkins
The Google Compute Engine (GCE) Plugin allows you to use GCE virtual machines (VMs) with Jenkins to execute build tasks. GCE VMs provision quickly, are destroyed by Jenkins when idle, and offer Preemptible VMs that run at a much lower price than regular VMs.
