# Running Windows VM's
* To run a VM as an agent, have both SSH and Java installed on the Windows Image. Chocolatey is recommended to install OpenSSH and Java.

## Creating a Windows Image
* Packer is used to build a Windows 2016 image from GCE with OpenSSH and Java pre-installed. Using the GCP cloud console, have the following 2 files on google cloud console.
  * For more information and an example of packer usage with the GCE jenkins plugin, see this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/using-jenkins-for-distributed-builds-on-compute-engine#create_a_jenkins_agent_image).
* Sample JSON file (jenkins-agent.json):
```
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "googlecompute",
      "project_id": "my-project-id",
      "source_image_family": "windows-2016",
      "source_image_project_id": "gce-uefi-images",
      "zone": "us-central1-a",
      "disk_size": "50",
      "image_name": "jenkins-agent-windows-{{timestamp}}",
      "image_family": "jenkins-agent-windows",
      "communicator": "winrm",
      "winrm_username": "packer_user",
      "winrm_insecure": true,
      "winrm_use_ssl": true,
      "metadata": {
        "windows-startup-script-cmd": "winrm quickconfig -quiet & net user /add packer_user & net localgroup administrators packer_user /add & winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic=\"true\"}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "powershell",
      "script": "windows-image-install.ps1"
    }
  ]
}
```

* sample windows-image-install.ps1
  * See this [file](windows-image-install.ps1)
  * The script installs Java and OpenSSH. Adding a user and using key-based authentication are optional but recommended. These requirements are all done in the sample script above.

* To have packer build this image, run the following in google cloud console:
```
./packer build jenkins-agent.json
```

* The terminal should output:
```
A disk image was created: jenkins-agent-windows-1494277483
```

* The jenkins-agent-1494277483 is the resulting image's name. It will now be available in the Jenkins UI under Configure System. You can now launch your Windows agent!

## Running a Windows Agent on Jenkins
* Have the following fields (Windows? and username) checked and filled out, respectively. The username must already exist in your agent.
  * See the earlier section on building an image for examples of how to configure a user

### Creating Credentials
* For security, if you wish to authenticate with the password (have it already configured for earlier said username), create a username/password credential in Jenkins.
![Password certificate](windows_images/usernamepassword.png)

* If authenticating with keys, install the SSH Credentials plugin. Create the credential in Jenkins; leave the passphrase portion blank.

* Your credentials should now show up under Manage Jenkins > Configure System.

* You must enter either credentials for either the password or key authentication option.
