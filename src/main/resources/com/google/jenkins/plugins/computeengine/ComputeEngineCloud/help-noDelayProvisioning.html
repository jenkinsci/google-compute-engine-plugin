By default Jenkins estimates load to avoid over-provisioning of cloud nodes.
With this option enabled, a new node is created on GCP as soon as NodeProvisioner detects need for more agents.
In worst case scenarios, this will results in some extra nodes provisioned on GCP, which will be shortly terminated.
