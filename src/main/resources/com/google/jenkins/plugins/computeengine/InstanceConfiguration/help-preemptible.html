    A preemptible VM is an instance that you can create and run at a much lower price than normal instances. However,
    Compute Engine might terminate (preempt) these instances if it requires access to those resources for other tasks.
    Preemptible instances are excess Compute Engine capacity so their availability varies with usage.
    <p>
        See the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible">Preemptible VM Instances</a>
        documentation for more information.
