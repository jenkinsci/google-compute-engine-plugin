    Enable this option if the launched machine is a Windows VM. The Windows VM must have the OpenSSH server feature
    installed on it, Java installed on it, and you must have configured an administrative user with a username and password.
    <p>
        The configured username and password should be set in the "Run as user" and "Windows account credentials" fields.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not have the aforementioned pre-installed, you can use the following startup script to automatically set up the minimum requirements.
        In this example the Windows username is "jenkins" and the password is "P@ssword2". <br/>
        See the help file below for Windows private SSH key if you wish to authenticate SSH via keys.
