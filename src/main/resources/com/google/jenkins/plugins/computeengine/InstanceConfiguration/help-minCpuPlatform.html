   Google datacenters offer varied CPU Platforms. Each CPU platform supports incremental features like AVX-2, AVX-512, and so on.
    Systems-related features like clock speed and memory access seek time can vary across CPU platforms. Different zones support multiple CPU
    Platforms, and you can select a CPU platform for your VM instances that supports the specific needs of your workloads using minimum platform selection.

        documentation for more information.
